#### Hello, I'm dj1ch,
but you can call me ditch or dj(i kinda slammed by keyboard making this username).

## Projects I am working on...
- Minigotchi, a pwnagotchi somewhat loaded on a raspberry pi pico (main focus right now)
- An html website that is supposed to show the hw bulletin. The original website isn't the best on anyone's eyes.
- Other stuff...

##

### Note:
School is making me busy rn, I am not always online. Because of this, many of my porjects are not tended to/actively maintained. This includes the html-shitpost, pwnagotchi-for-pi4, and many others.
