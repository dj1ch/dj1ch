# ðŸ‘‹ Hey, I'm dj1ch  

**Back from my hiatus.**  

I'm a high school student/athlete passionate about learning concepts like Computer Science and Electrical Engineering. I often work with SBCs, microcontrollers, and other small devices. When I'm not coding, I actively pursue martial arts and go for runs.
