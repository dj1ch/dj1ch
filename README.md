## [Click here for my portfolio!](https://dj1ch.github.io)

I'm dj1ch, but you can call me ditch or dj(i kinda slammed by keyboard making this username). I'm pretty active, so feel free to reach out to me whenever possible.

## Projects I am working on...
I don't maintain all of these at the same time, but at this point in time for me I will not have as much time for these projects like I used too. I'll work on minigotchi until it is ready, and for my other projects push put my final bug patches before I become less active and focus more on my schooling and potential future career. It's looking bright and I don't want to miss an opportunity such as this. Thanks again for all the opportunities Github has given me. It's been fun coding with everyone!

- Minigotchi, a pwnagotchi somewhat loaded on an ESP8266.
- Another Raspberry Pi Pico project on the way!

## Unmaintained/development paused...
- A cool fork of the pico-ducky, with mouse support. I also added some scripts for these for you to use! Most of them are written by me. I plan on making my own version of this. 
- My (new) portfolio website.
- Skid attack, a python script that will brick a skid's computer
- Pico honeypot, a honeypot that pretends to be a debian linux server, with the help of a container

**Small-Catch and Media-Nest are deleted projects. ~~I do not have access to the old code. It was not archived either.~~ nuh uh**
