<h2>ðŸ‘‹ Hi there</h2>

<h3>15 y/o Embedded Stack Developer</h3>

I'm dj1ch, a 15-year-old developer in the Embedded Stack. 

At the moment, I enjoy working with single-board computers (SBCs) and microcontrollers, among other small devices. Most of my work involves cybersecurity-related projects because I enjoy hacking hardware. I'm working on the Minigotchi, a port of Pwnagotchi to the ESP8266/ESP32.

Feel free to reach out to me on [Discord](https://discord.com/users/871252436038320209) or by emailing tg.1ch0712@gmail.com (preferably email)
